See the dictionary header for full documentation.

Note: this version of the dictionary is not usable with FreeDict TEI-to-DICT scripts --
it is an attempt to preserve the structural distinctions made in the SGML version.

A DICT version derived from it by Mateusz Kielar should be available at https://code.google.com/p/eng-pol/

The first release (0.1) is accompanied by

* an XSLT script that documents the transformation from SGML (actually, an XML-ised version
  of it, with some minor fixes introduced, and with transcriptions transduced into IPA)
  [this script unfortunately has gone missing]
* a notes file that documents the process of the initial SGML->XML conversion and 
  contains hints on where to look for problems; in etc/
